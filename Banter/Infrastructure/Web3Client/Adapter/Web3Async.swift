/// A protocol that provides asynchronous access to Ethereum blockchain functionality.
///
/// `Web3Async` offers methods to interact with an Ethereum node using Swift's modern async/await pattern,
/// allowing for more readable and maintainable blockchain interaction code.
///
/// - Important: All methods in this protocol are designed to be called with Swift's `async`/`await` syntax
///   and may throw errors related to network connectivity, JSON parsing, or blockchain-specific issues.

  ///   - address: The Ethereum address to check
  ///   - block: The block state to query (latest, earliest, pending, or specific block number)
  /// - Returns: The number of transactions sent from the address as an `EthereumQuantity`
  /// - Throws: An error if the request fails or the response cannot be parsed

  ///   - invocation: The contract method invocation to estimate
  ///   - from: The optional Ethereum address that would send the transaction
