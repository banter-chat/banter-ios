- Ensure testability and maintainability

## 4. Non-goals

- Message update mechanisms (to be addressed separately)
- Network layer implementation details
- UI implementation details
- Message storage/caching (may be addressed separately)

## 5. Selected Approach: Timestamp-Based Pagination

After evaluating different options, we have selected timestamp-based pagination for retrieving messages. This approach uses message timestamps to paginate through history, providing a good balance between implementation simplicity and performance.

### 5.1 Protocol Definition

```swift
protocol MessageRepository {
    // Retrieve messages with pagination
    func getMessages(chatId: String, before: Date?, limit: Int) async throws -> [Message]
    
    // Optional: Get most recent messages
    func getRecentMessages(chatId: String, limit: Int) async throws -> [Message]
    
    // Optional: Load messages around a specific point in time
    func getMessagesAround(chatId: String, timestamp: Date, limit: Int) async throws -> [Message]
}
```

### 5.2 Implementation Details

```swift
class MessageRepositoryImpl: MessageRepository {
    private let networkService: NetworkService
    
    init(networkService: NetworkService) {
        self.networkService = networkService
    }
    
    func getMessages(chatId: String, before: Date? = nil, limit: Int = 50) async throws -> [Message] {
        return try await networkService.fetchMessages(
            chatId: chatId,
            before: before,
            limit: limit
        )
    }
    
    func getRecentMessages(chatId: String, limit: Int = 50) async throws -> [Message] {
        return try await networkService.fetchMessages(
            chatId: chatId,
            before: nil,
            limit: limit
        )
    }
    
    func getMessagesAround(chatId: String, timestamp: Date, limit: Int = 50) async throws -> [Message] {
        return try await networkService.fetchMessagesAround(
            chatId: chatId,
            timestamp: timestamp,
            limit: limit
        )
    }
}
```

### 5.3 Advantages of Timestamp-Based Pagination

- **Stability during updates**: New messages don't affect retrieval of historical messages
- **Natural fit for messaging**: Messages are naturally ordered by time
- **Efficient queries**: Databases can efficiently index and query by timestamp
- **UI-friendly**: Works well with standard "infinite scroll" UI patterns
- **Simplicity**: Relatively simple to implement compared to cursor-based or window-based approaches
- **Bidirectional support**: Can be extended to support loading newer messages with an `after` parameter

### 5.4 Disadvantages of Timestamp-Based Pagination

- **Timestamp collision handling**: Need strategy for messages with identical timestamps
- **Server-side consistency**: Requires consistent timestamp generation on the server
- **Timezone considerations**: May need to handle timezone issues with timestamps
- **Accuracy requirements**: Timestamps need sufficient precision for ordering
- **Jumping difficulties**: Not as efficient for jumping to arbitrary positions in history

### 5.5 Usage Example with SwiftUI

```swift
class ChatViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var messages: [Message] = []
    @Published var isLoadingMore = false
    private let messageRepository: MessageRepository
    private let chatId: String
    private var oldestMessageDate: Date?
    
    init(chatId: String, messageRepository: MessageRepository = MessageRepositoryImpl()) {
        self.chatId = chatId
        self.messageRepository = messageRepository
    }
    
    func loadInitialMessages() async {
        do {
            let initialMessages = try await messageRepository.getRecentMessages(
                chatId: chatId,
                limit: 30
            )
            
            await MainActor.run {
                self.messages = initialMessages.sorted(by: { $0.timestamp < $1.timestamp })
                self.oldestMessageDate = initialMessages.map { $0.timestamp }.min()
            }
        } catch {
            // Handle error
        }
    }
    
    func loadMoreMessages() async {
        guard let oldestDate = oldestMessageDate, !isLoadingMore else { return }
        
        await MainActor.run {
            isLoadingMore = true
        }
        
        do {
            let olderMessages = try await messageRepository.getMessages(
                chatId: chatId,
                before: oldestDate,
                limit: 30
            )
            
            await MainActor.run {
                if !olderMessages.isEmpty {
                    let sortedMessages = olderMessages.sorted(by: { $0.timestamp < $1.timestamp })
                    self.messages.insert(contentsOf: sortedMessages, at: 0)
                    self.oldestMessageDate = sortedMessages.map { $0.timestamp }.min()
                }
                isLoadingMore = false
            }
        } catch {
            await MainActor.run {
                isLoadingMore = false
            }
            // Handle error
        }
    }
}

struct ChatView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel: ChatViewModel
    @State private var messageText = ""
    
    init(chatId: String) {
        _viewModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: ChatViewModel(chatId: chatId))
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            LazyVStack {
                if !viewModel.messages.isEmpty {
                    Button("Load More") {
                        Task {
                            await viewModel.loadMoreMessages()
                        }
                    }
                    .opacity(viewModel.isLoadingMore ? 0.5 : 1.0)
                    .disabled(viewModel.isLoadingMore)
                }
                
                ForEach(viewModel.messages) { message in
                    MessageRow(message: message)
                }
            }
        }
        .task {
            await viewModel.loadInitialMessages()
        }
    }
}
```

## 6. Alternatives Considered

We evaluated several alternative approaches before selecting Timestamp-Based Pagination. Each had its own advantages and trade-offs:

### 6.1. Option A: Full History Retrieval

This approach retrieves the entire message history for a chat in a single request.

```swift
protocol MessageRepository {
    func getAllMessages(chatId: String) async throws -> [Message]
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Simplest implementation
- All messages available immediately
- Easy to implement locally
- No need for additional requests during scrolling

**Disadvantages:**
- Extremely inefficient for large chats
- Poor initial load performance
- High bandwidth usage
- Memory issues for very large conversations

**Reason for not selecting:** While this is the simplest approach, it becomes impractical for chats with more than a few dozen messages. The performance and bandwidth costs make it unsuitable for most real-world applications.

### 6.2. Option B: Offset-Based Pagination

This approach uses offset and limit parameters to paginate through the message history.

```swift
protocol MessageRepository {
    func getMessages(chatId: String, offset: Int, limit: Int) async throws -> [Message]
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Familiar database-friendly pattern
- Simple implementation on the server side
- Works well with SQL databases
- Precise control over the number of items per page

**Disadvantages:**
- Unstable during updates (offsets shift when new messages arrive)
- Performance degrades for large offsets
- Difficult to implement "scroll to load more" UI patterns
- Potential for missed messages or duplicates when new messages arrive

**Reason for not selecting:** This approach is unstable for messaging applications where new messages are frequently added. As new messages arrive, offsets change, making it difficult to implement a smooth scrolling experience.

### 6.3. Option C: Cursor-Based Pagination

This approach uses message IDs as cursors for pagination.

```swift
protocol MessageRepository {
    func getMessages(chatId: String, beforeId: String?, limit: Int) async throws -> [Message]
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Most stable during updates
- Very efficient for large datasets
- Works well with "infinite scroll" UI patterns
- No issues with identical timestamps
- Good performance with NoSQL databases

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex implementation
- Requires maintaining cursor state
- May need additional metadata in responses
- More difficult to jump to arbitrary points in history
- Less intuitive API

**Reason for not selecting:** Although this approach offers better stability and performance than timestamp-based pagination, the additional complexity in implementation makes it harder to justify for small to medium-sized applications. However, it should be considered for very large scale applications.

### 6.4. Option D: Window-Based Loading

This approach loads messages in "windows" around the current view position.

```swift
protocol MessageRepository {
    func getMessageWindow(chatId: String, centerTimestamp: Date, radius: Int) async throws -> [Message]
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Optimized for random access to different parts of the conversation
- Efficient for jumping to specific points in conversation
- Good for search results viewing
- Can be optimized for visible screen area

**Disadvantages:**
- Most complex implementation
- Difficult to coordinate with typical server APIs
- Challenging memory management
- Complex UI synchronization
- May result in gaps in the conversation view

**Reason for not selecting:** This approach is the most complex and is typically only necessary for specialized applications with requirements for random access to different parts of large conversations.

## 7. Performance Considerations

For timestamp-based pagination, we recommend the following optimizations:

1. **Index timestamps in the database** to ensure efficient queries
2. **Add a secondary sort key** (like message ID) for messages with identical timestamps
3. **Consider response size limits** to prevent downloading too many messages at once
4. **Implement client-side caching** to reduce redundant network requests
5. **Use appropriate batch sizes** (typically 20-50 messages per request)
6. **Consider loading strategy** based on initial view (latest messages vs specific point in time)

## 8. Future Considerations

1. **Bidirectional pagination**: Extending the API to support `after` parameter for loading newer messages
2. **Jump to date**: Adding functionality to jump to specific points in the conversation history
3. **Search integration**: How to integrate message search with the pagination strategy
4. **Read state synchronization**: Efficiently tracking read state across message loads
5. **Media optimization**: Special handling for media-heavy conversations

## 9. Conclusion

Timestamp-based pagination offers the best balance between implementation complexity and user experience for most messaging applications. It provides stable pagination even when new messages arrive and works well with common UI patterns like infinite scrolling.

For applications that may scale to very large conversation histories (thousands of messages), cursor-based pagination should be considered as an alternative, though it comes with additional implementation complexity.
